The established bitmap file format consists of a BITMAPFILEHEADER 
structure followed by a BITMAPINFOHEADER, BITMAPV4HEADER, or 
BITMAPV5HEADER structure. An array of RGBQUAD structures 
(also called a color table) follows the bitmap information header 
structure. The color table is followed by a second array of
indexes into the color table (the actual bitmap data).
